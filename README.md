# ZodiacMotion

**ZodiacMotion** is a Python program that creates a zodiacal motion between two different times according to given latitude and longitude values. The program calculates the zodiacal positions repeatedly by adding the amount of time increase to the starting time until it becomes equal to the finishing date. The increase time amount range is between 1 to 3600 seconds. Displaying the chart depends on the refresh scale which has a range between 0 and 10 seconds. The house system and orb factors are changeable.
